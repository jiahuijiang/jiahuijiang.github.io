Growing up my parents worked long hours and often wouldn't be back home by my bedtime.
Alone in the dark, the only source of solace was from my pillow-side stuffed animals — the companions who protected and comforted me.
<br/>
As I transitioned into adulthood, I relinquished my childhood comforts and embraced what I believed were necessary for adulthood — strength and self-sufficiency. Yet, even as an adult, I yearn for a cuddly comforting presence in moments of aloneness.
<br/>
Sloths are what I aspire to be. They are kind and happy. Their arms always open wide, offering warmth and ease.

I made this breathing sloth plush for <a target="_blank" class="no-text-decoration" href="https://www.instagram.com/workinprogressnyc/"><u>@workinprogressnyc</u></a>'s Valentine's day showcase
at <a target="_blank" class="no-text-decoration" href="https://www.instagram.com/personanycstudio/"><u>Persona</u></a>. The theme was self-healing and self-love. I found it absolutely magically watching people's eyes open wide when they felt the breathing, then smiling and enjoying a moment with the sloths in silence.

        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/images/posts/breathing-sloths/event-night.jpg" title="Event night" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

The breathing is mimicked by an air balloon connected to two air pumps and a valve.
<br/>
I used two air pumps to get a shorter inhalation and a relaxing long exhalation.

Hope you enjoy the cuddling sloth &#129445;
