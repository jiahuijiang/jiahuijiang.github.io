When I went to ITP Camp in 2023, one of my favorite sessions was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_imagima/">Chika</a>'s projection mapping. I bought a projector in the middle of the first session, but never actually did a project after that &#128517;

projection mapping workshop. I bought a projector in the middle of the first session, but never actually ended up making a project with it 😅

A year later, a friend organized a creative retreat. We drove upstate and locked ourselves in a house far from everything to work on creative projects. I finally got a chance to do something with everything I had learned and seen.

I’ve always liked projects that evoke emotion far more than ones that are just cool or trippy. During the session at ITP, Chika showed us a project called <a href="https://motomichi.com/movingwork/v/tiny-people-tribe">"Tiny People Tribe"</a>. It was playful, and it made me smile in awe.

This project is a copycat in the most literal sense — I made a cat version of it. I hope it brings a little cheerfulness into your life.
